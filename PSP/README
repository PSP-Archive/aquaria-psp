About the Aquaria PSP port
==========================

This is an unofficial, work-in-progress port of Aquaria to the Sony PSP.
At present, it is marginally playable through at least the first few
areas, but still runs very slowly.


Important notice (limitations of this version)
----------------------------------------------
Due to Aquaria's memory requirements, the game will only run on a PSP-2000
("Slim") or later.  Aquaria will _not_ run on a PSP-1000 ("Phat").  Sorry!

Save early and often!  Memory fragmentation issues which are normally
unnoticeable on a PC can cause the PSP to crash after playing for a
while.  It may help to periodically exit the game (to the PSP's menu)
after saving, then restart and reload your game.

Other issues:

- The Key Config menu and Help screen crash the game, so they have been
  disabled for the PSP.  (The most likely cause seems to be that the
  rendering method used by the FTGL library is too inefficient for use
  on the PSP; it might be necessary to use prerendered screens.)

- It's not currently possible to check the songs in the game menu.  Pay
  close attention when you learn them!

- There is a race condition in the file I/O thread which on rare
  occasion may cause garbled audio output or crash the program.  The bug
  is more likely to be seen when many sound effects are playing at once.


Using the Aquaria PSP Builder
-----------------------------
You can use the "Aquaria PSP Builder" program to build the game using a
precompiled copy of the PSP program, though you will of course need the
data files from the commercial distribution of the game.  The builder is
self-contained, so that you don't need to install any compilers or other
tools -- simply run the program and follow the prompts.

The first time you use the builder, it will convert the Aquaria data
files to a format suitable for use by the PSP.  This is a fairly
time-consuming process, and will typically take 10-15 minutes even on
a fast PC.  These converted files will be saved in the folder you
specify as the "New PSP data folder"; you can delete this folder when
the build finishes, but if you keep it on your system, you can then
reuse it when a newer version of the PSP program is released to save
time during the build.

When the builder finishes its work, the folder you specified in the
"Output game folder" field will contain all the files needed to play
Aquaria on the PSP.  Copy this folder to your PSP, either using the
PSP's USB mode or a separate Memory Stick reader, under the "PSP/GAME"
folder.  For example, if you use Windows and your PSP is connected as
drive E:, you should end up with the following folder structure:

E: --> PSP --> GAME --> AQUARIA

where "AQUARIA" is the name of the output game folder you created (any
name is fine).

Once you have Aquaria installed on your PSP, skip down to the "Default
controls" section for information on playing the game.

Note that the current version of the builder does not include an icon
with the program, so the game will show up in the PSP's game list with
the default grey icon.  Also note that the links in the "about this
program" screen will not work if your system web browser is
misconfigured, or if (on Linux) you do not have the "gvfs" package
installed.


Source code build prerequisites
-------------------------------
The PSP port of Aquaria uses the unofficial PSP SDK from ps2dev.org; the
author builds using Subversion revision 2494 of that SDK.  You will
naturally need a cross-compiler as well; the code assumes GCC, and was
built using GCC 4.4.4.

In order to build Aquaria for PSP, you should also have the following
packages prebuilt and installed for the PSP cross-compiling environment:
    libpng
    zlib
    freetype (optional)
    libogg (optional)
    libvorbis (optional)
    lua (optional)
If you don't have one or more of the optional packages installed, you can
set the appropriate Makefile variable to zero to use the version included
in the Aquaria source code distribution (see "Building the source" below).

Gentoo Linux users can download a Portage overlay from
http://achurch.org/cgi-bin/hg/portage-psp/ which includes ebuilds for all
of the above packages.  To install them:
    emerge psp-binutils psp-gcc pspsdk
    emerge -1 psp-gcc pspsdk  # to install the C++ portions
    emerge psp-zlib psp-libpng psp-libogg psp-libvorbis psp-lua psp-freetype
If you have the "layman" tool installed, add the URL:
    http://achurch.org/portage-psp-layman.xml
to your layman configuration file, then run "layman -f" followed by
"layman -a psp-devel" to add the Portage overlay to your system.


Building the source
-------------------
The PSP port of Aquaria uses a traditional Makefile rather than the CMake
build system (mostly because CMake is poorly suited to cross-compiling).
To build Aquaria for PSP, simply run "make" in the "PSP" directory.  You
will probably need GNU Make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to build
correctly; this is installed by default on all modern Linux distributions,
but you may need to install it yourself on other systems.

If you have the PSP SDK and other libraries installed in a location other
than /usr/psp, you can pass the "PSPROOT=/path/to/psp/root" and
"PSPSDK=/path/to/psp/sdk" options on the "make" command line.  For
example, if you have headers and libraries installed in /usr/local/psp
and the SDK in /usr/local/psp/sdk, run: "make PSPROOT=/usr/local/psp" to
build.

For some packages, you can choose between the version of the package
installed on your system (if any) and the version included in the Aquaria
source code distribution.  For example, by passing "USE_INSTALLED_LUA=0"
on the "make" command line, the build will use the version of Lua
included under the "Aquaria" source directory rather than any version you
may have already built for the PSP on your system.  See the top of the
Makefile for a full list of such packages.  (Note that the build process
does _not_ autodetect whether you have the packages installed, and will
attempt to use preinstalled libraries for all packages unless you specify
otherwise.)

The Makefile normally prints a single concise line for each build action,
such as compiling a source file.  To see the actual commands being
executed, pass "V=1" on the "make" command line.

If you get a "multiple definition of 'strtof'" error during the final
link, either:
    1) do a "make clean", then re-run "make" with "CAN_OVERRIDE_STRTOF=0"
       on the command line; or
    2) patch the Newlib C library to allow the strtof() function to be
       overridden, rebuild and reinstall newlib, then run "make" to
       repeat the final link of Aquaria.
See the Makefile for details.  For Gentoo Linux users, the "pspsdk"
package in the Portage overlay at http://achurch.org includes an
appropriate Newlib patch.

If you want the game and the system save files (settings and achievements)
to have custom icons, set the ICON0_* variables appropriately in the
Makefile.  The default setting uses the Aquaria title logo from the
commercial distribution, which is not included with this source code.
You will need the Netpbm package installed to generate the icon file.

Running "make clean" will remove the executable, object code, and related
files.  "make spotless" will remove those files as well as the dependency
control files used by the Makefile itself, and should give you a pristine
source tree.


Installing
----------
To install Aquaria, create a directory on your PSP's Memory Stick under
/PSP/GAME, perhaps /PSP/GAME/AQUARIA, and copy into that directory:

    EBOOT.PBP (created by the build)
    ICON0.PNG (created by the build if you specified an icon file)

    _Either:_
        The following directories from the commercial Aquaria distribution:
            data, gfx, mus, scripts, sfx, vox
    _Or:_
        aquaria.dat (see "Using a package file" below)

    Optionally, the _mods directory from the commercial distribution,
        along with any user-created mods you want to install (however,
        mods that require a mouse, such as editors, may not work properly)

However, see the "Converting data files" and "Using a package file"
sections below for important notes regarding the data files.


Converting data files
---------------------
While Aquaria for PSP will run with the stock data files distributed
with the commercial version of the game, it will run very slowly.  This
is due to the significant cost of decompressing and shrinking (because
the PSP can't handle textures larger than 512x512 pixels) all of the PNG
textures on load, and the extreme effort required to decode Ogg Vorbis
audio on the PSP (a single stereo stream consumes around 50% CPU time,
even at the highest possible CPU clock speed).

To address this problem, there are two tools in the "tools" subdirectory:
"pngtotex" and "oggtomp3".  The former converts PNG textures to half-size,
uncompressed ".tex" data files which the PSP can read in quickly, while
the latter converts Ogg Vorbis audio to MP3, which the PSP can decode on
a separate processor to save time.  It is _very_ strongly recommended
that you use these tools to convert all of the Aquaria data files before
running Aquaria on the PSP.

When loading textures or sound files, the PSP port will automatically
look for ".tex" and ".mp3" files with the same name and in the same
directory as the file being loaded, and will use those files if they
exist.  However (as of the present version), you must keep the original
PNG and Ogg files as well for Aquaria to work correctly.

To build the tools, run "make tools" from the "PSP" directory.  You will
need the zlib, libpng, libogg, libvorbis, and lame packages installed
(on your native system, of course).

There is also a script in the "tools" directory, "convert-all-data.sh",
which you can use to convert all PNG and Ogg files in one go.  Run the
script without any command line parameters for documentation.


Using a package file
--------------------
Aquaria for PSP has the ability to load its data files from a "package
file", which is a single file containing all of the data used by Aquaria.
The use of a package file can improve load times dramatically; in one
early test, the time taken on the initial loading screen dropped from
460 seconds (nearly eight minutes!) to just 14 seconds.

The package file format used by the PSP port of Aquaria is called "PKG",
for lack of a better name, and is generated by the "build-pkg" tool in
the "PSP/tools" directory.  There is also a script, "create-package.sh",
which will save you the time of writing the "build-pkg" control file
needed to create the package file for Aquaria.

One caveat to keep in mind is that any directory included in the package
file will _not_ be searched on the Memory Stick when looking for files.
For example, if you include a "_mods" directory in the package file, you
will not later be able to add mods by creating a "_mods" subdirectory in
the Aquaria installation directory on your Memory Stick.


Default controls
----------------
The default controls for the PSP are as follows:

Analog pad      -- move Naija
Directional pad -- select options in menus
L/R triggers    -- change page in menus
Cross    -- swim faster; select menu option (left mouse button equivalent)
Circle   -- interact with object; other actions (right mouse button equiv.)
Square   -- revert to normal form; select food for cooking
Triangle -- display world map; remove food from cooking slot
Start    -- open/close in-game menu; pause cutscene
Select   -- cook food; skip cutscene when paused

While in the food menu, the currently selected food item can be discarded
into the environment by holding Select and pressing Triangle while the
cooking slots are empty.

In the world map, use the analog pad to scroll, or hold Circle while
moving the analog pad up or down to zoom.


Save files
----------
Aquaria for PSP saves all of its data, both saved games and system data,
using the PSP's native save data system.  The save files will show up on
the PSP's save data menu just like save data from other games.  Saved
game files use a screenshot from the game as the save file image, just
like the in-game load/save menu; system data files (user settings and
achievements) use the same icon as the game itself, if you created one
when you built the program.

One side effect of using the PSP's save data system is that the user
settings file cannot be edited outside of Aquaria, since the PSP
automatically checksums and encrypts all save files.  For normal play
this should not be a problem, but if the Makefile variable
ALLOW_SETTINGS_OVERRIDE is set to 1 when building from the source code,
Aquaria will attempt to load a "usersettings.xml" file on startup, and
will use that file if it exists rather than loading the PSP save file.
However, settings changed in the in-game options menu are saved _only_
to the PSP save file, so those changes will not appear when the game is
restarted unless the "usersettings.xml" file is removed or renamed.


Notes on the source code
------------------------
Much of the PSP port's source code was taken from an engine I developed
for another game.  There is a fair amount of code which is unused by
Aquaria, but which I included because it was simpler than going through
and determining which parts to cut and paste.  Also be aware that much of
the source code documentation is in Japanese, which is the comment
language I used for that engine.
